## Other Items to Learn
- The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the amount that would be lost in a single occurrence (AV) times the risk factor (RF). The annual loss expectancy (ALE) is the total cost of a risk to an organization on an annual basis. This is determined by multiplying the SLE by the annual rate of occurrence (ARO).
- APT (Active Persistent Threat) can be  found with an Indicator of Compromise(IOC)
- Differences between Clear and Purging Data
	- Clear is sanitize user addressable data with one's or zeros once or less than three times
	- Purging is eliminate data from being feasibly recovered even in a laboratory environment, such as degaussing or cryptographic erase function
	- Wiping occurs by using a software tool to overwrite drive several times
- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis - graphical representation of the attackers approach relative to a kill chain 
- The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides explicit pseudo-code examples for detecting or mitigating a given threat within a network and ties specific behaviors back to individual actors. 
- The Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain provides a general life cycle description of how attacks occur but does not deal with the specifics of how to mitigate them. 
- OpenIOC contains a depth of research on APTs but does not integrate the detections and mitigation strategy.


- Need to learn differences between
	- Data Owner
	- Data Steward
	- Data Protection Officer
	- Data Controller

- Learn difference between
	- phishing - email
	- vishing voicemail and phone calls
	- pharming - domain spoofing

- With consensus/social proof impersonation, an attacker fools users into believing that a malicious website is legitimate by posting fake reviews. The victims believe the reviews and place their trust in the website.

- One of the tools of social engineers is to be likable, and to present the requests they make as completely reasonable.

- Many people find it difficult to refuse a request by someone they perceive as superior to them. Social engineers can try to exploit this behavior to intimidate their target by pretending to be someone of authority.

- Creating a false sense of urgency can disturb people's ordinary decision-making process. The social engineer can try to pressure his or her target by demanding a quick response.
