- The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the amount that would be lost in a single occurrence (AV) times the risk factor (RF). The annual loss expectancy (ALE) is the total cost of a risk to an organization on an annual basis. This is determined by multiplying the SLE by the annual rate of occurrence (ARO).
- APT (Active Persistent Threat) can be  found with an Indicator of Compromise(IOC)
- Differences between Clear and Purging Data
	- Clear is sanitize user addressable data with one's or zeros once or less than three times
	- Purging is eliminate data from being feasibly recovered even in a laboratory environment, such as degaussing or cryptographic erase function
	- Wiping occurs by using a software tool to overwrite drive several times
- Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis - graphical representation of the attackers approach relative to a kill chain 
- The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides explicit pseudo-code examples for detecting or mitigating a given threat within a network and ties specific behaviors back to individual actors. 
- The Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain provides a general life cycle description of how attacks occur but does not deal with the specifics of how to mitigate them. 
- OpenIOC contains a depth of research on APTs but does not integrate the detections and mitigation strategy.
